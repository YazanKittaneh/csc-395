Introduction to haskel

Haskel is a functional programing language
	thinking about programs as transformation on data

Statically typed: all type errors will be caught at runtime
	* at the same time, you don't have to explicitly say what variable is what (type interface)

infix functions: functions such as "+" or "*" that take in parameters by sandwitching them 

prefix functions: functions that take parameters after they are called
	(ie succ 8 = 9)

	* they have the highest precidence in functions
	  i.e: succ 8  is equivilent to (succ 8)

	** we can make a prefix function a infix function by surrounding it with 'func'
	  i.e: div 3 8   ->   3 'div' 8

if statements:
	* else statement is mandatory
	* an expression because it always returns something
	
We usually use ' to either denote a strict version of a function (one that isn't lazy) or a slightly modified version of a function or a variable. Because ' is a valid character in functions, we can make a function like this.
